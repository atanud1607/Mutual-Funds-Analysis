Mutual Funds Performance Analysis Dashboard

Description:
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze the performance of mutual funds over various time periods. The dashboard is designed to provide detailed insights into the performance of mutual funds based on average returns over 1, 3, and 5 years, examine the correlation between different return periods, and categorize the top-performing funds. This project aims to help stakeholders make informed investment decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
Business Questions Addressed:

Performance Overview:

Objective: Evaluate how mutual funds perform based on average returns over 1, 3, and 5 years.
Approach: Calculated the average returns for each fund over the specified periods and presented the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
Year by Year Analysis:

Objective: Determine if there is a correlation between 3-year average returns and 5-year average returns.
Approach: Used scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the two return periods. Analyzed the correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship. Additionally, plotted returns against different risk types to provide a comprehensive view.
Fund Category vs. Average Return Percentages:

Objective: Visualize the relationship between fund categories and their average return percentages.
Approach: Created bar charts and pie charts to depict the average returns for different fund categories, highlighting the performance distribution across categories.
Category Insights – Top Performing Funds:

Objective: Identify the top 10 performing funds within each category over the past 5 years.
Approach: Sorted and ranked funds based on their 5-year average returns and highlighted the top 10 performers within each category using tables and conditional formatting for easy identification.
Category Insights – Top Performing Funds:

Objective: Identify the top 10 performing funds within each category over the past 3 years.
Approach: Similar to the 5-year analysis, sorted and ranked funds based on their 3-year average returns and visualized the top 10 performers within each category.
Category Insights – Top Performing Funds:

Objective: Identify the top 10 performing funds within each category over the past 1 year.
Approach: Followed the same methodology as for the 3-year and 5-year periods, focusing on 1-year average returns to identify and visualize top performers.
Fund Category Distribution:

Objective: Determine the percentage distribution of various fund categories.
Approach: Created a pie chart to show the proportion of each fund category within the entire dataset, providing a clear view of the category composition.

Tools and Techniques:

Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, calculation of summary statistics, and creation of visualizations.
Visualization Tools: Excel charts, including scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts.
Data Analysis: Correlation analysis and ranking techniques to identify top-performing funds.
Key Insights:

The dashboard provides a clear overview of mutual fund performance over different time frames.
Visualizations reveal the correlation between different return periods and the risk associated with various funds.
The top-performing funds within each category are easily identifiable, aiding in investment decision-making.
The distribution of fund categories helps in understanding the composition of the mutual fund market.
Conclusion:
This Mutual Funds Performance Analysis Dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to analyze and compare the performance of various mutual funds. By leveraging the insights provided, investors can make more informed decisions based on historical performance data.
